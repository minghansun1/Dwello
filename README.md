# Dwello

Dwello is a web app that recommends neighborhoods based on many different user preferences, including salary ranges for different industries, crime rate, population density, median income, cost of living, etc.
We haven't written code yet, but we'll have a backend folder for our django backend and a frontend folder for our React frontend.
